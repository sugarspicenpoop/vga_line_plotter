FPGA hardware implementation of a VGA line plotter using the Zynq 7000 SoC on the Zedboard.

# Before you use
This project uses custom IPs not present in this repository. I no longer have access to these custom IPs, so there's nothing I can do if the Tcl script fails.

# How to use?
1. Open Vivado 2022.2
2. Click **Tools** then **Run Tcl Script**
3. Select `lab2_boot_modes.tcl`
